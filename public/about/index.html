Daniel/King Estates Open Space Park (KEOS) in order to protect the land from development. The eastern slope, between Howard School and King Estates school, was an existing City of Oakland park established in the early ‘60s. However the vast majority of land was privately owned. A land trust acquired it and held it until the City could purchase it. Many of our neighbors worked with Citizens of Oakland for Open Space (COOS) to pass Measure M (the KEOS property was purchased with Measure M funds).</p><p>Clyde Grimes, a retired architect with ties to University of California, Berkeley, recruited their Landscape Architecture Department to do a master plan for the park as a masters thesis project. UC students and the community worked over the course of a year to produce the master plan, which was vetted by all the City of Oakland departments and then passed by City Council in 1998. KEOS Master Plan.</p><h2 id=other-oknia-projects-and-achievements>Other OKNIA projects and achievements:</h2><ul><li><p>1989 - established a Clean Streets Committee responsible for collecting litter on Fontaine Street and Golf Links Road.
