      <description>OKNIA.org is a community based 501 (C3) nonprofit formed to enhance the livability of the neighborhoods surrounding KEOS. We do this by establishing and maintaining an open line of communication and liaison among the neighbors, government agencies and other neighborhoods.
Because of ongoing City budget constraints and competing priorities, OKNIA.org directs a lot of time and attention toward maintaining our local open space.
Here is what OKNIA has accomplished since July 2023: OKNIA volunteers constructed entrance bulletin boards and incised KEOS signage (funded by a grant from Keep Oakland Beautiful) in order to facilitate better communication with park users and to indicate that the open space is not just a vacant lot.</description>
