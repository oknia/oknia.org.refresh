      <description>In 1982, OKNIA consolidated two pre-existing, non-chartered organizations to the north and south of what is now the Glenn W. Daniel/King Estates Open Space Park (KEOS) in order to protect the land from development. The eastern slope, between Howard School and King Estates school, was an existing City of Oakland park established in the early â€˜60s. However the vast majority of land was privately owned. A land trust acquired it and held it until the City could purchase it.</description>

      <title>Native Species Seedlings for Open Space</title>

      <description>Hi All,
We want to thank all of the volunteers who have helped OKNIA&amp;rsquo;s ongoing efforts of meadow restoration within King Estate Open Space.
In addition to invasive species removal, this year&amp;rsquo;s winter season we would like to plant native species into selected areas within the Open Space.
For this we need volunteers to help raise seedlings for transplant after the rains have started. Last summer we gathered wildflower seeds, section by section a few days before the goats chomped them.</description>
