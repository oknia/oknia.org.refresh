We do this by establishing and maintaining an open line of communication and liaison among the neighbors, government agencies and other neighborhoods.
Because of ongoing City budget constraints and competing priorities, OKNIA.org directs a lot of time and attention toward maintaining our local open space.
Here is what OKNIA has accomplished since July 2023: OKNIA volunteers constructed entrance bulletin boards and incised KEOS signage (funded by a grant from Keep Oakland Beautiful) in order to facilitate better communication with park users and to indicate that the open space is not just a vacant lot.</description></item><item><title>Board</title><link>https://oknia.org/board/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 10:15:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://oknia.org/board/</guid><description>Eastmont Hills Ike Arum Pamm Baker Art Clark King Estate Marshall Hasbrouck, Interim Chair Tamara Torrey, Vice-Chair Oak Knoll Aijay Adams, Secretary Rebecca Palm-Song</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://oknia.org/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 11:05:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://oknia.org/about/</guid><description>In 1982, OKNIA consolidated two pre-existing, non-chartered organizations to the north and south of what is now the Glenn W. Daniel/King Estates Open Space Park (KEOS) in order to protect the land from development. The eastern slope, between Howard School and King Estates school, was an existing City of Oakland park established in the early â€˜60s. However the vast majority of land was privately owned. A land trust acquired it and held it until the City could purchase it.</description></item><item><title>Boundaries</title><link>https://oknia.org/boundaries/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 11:05:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://oknia.org/boundaries/</guid><description>
