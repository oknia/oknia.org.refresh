Daniel/King Estates Open Space Park (KEOS) in order to protect the land from development. The eastern slope, between Howard School and King Estates school, was an existing City of Oakland park established in the early â€˜60s. However the vast majority of land was privately owned. A land trust acquired it and held it until the City could purchase it.</description></item><item><title>Boundaries</title><link>https://oknia.org/boundaries/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 11:05:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://oknia.org/boundaries/</guid><description>
